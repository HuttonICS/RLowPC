\title{Consensus network integrated from average edge ranks}
\usage{
average.consensus(adjmatrix.list, directed = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjmatrix.list}{a list of inferred network matrices with same rownames and colnames.Names of the network matrices must be given in the list.}

\item{directed}{logical. If TRUE, the network is considered as directed. If FALSE, the upper triangular part of the symmetric matrix is used to calculate the rank matrix}
}
\value{
A network with rank weighted edges. The weights are rescale to 0-1 and hihger values indicate higher ranks.
}
\description{
Consensus network is built from taking the average ranks of the edges from multiple network predictions.
}
